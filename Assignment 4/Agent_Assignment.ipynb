The basis for this aspirational vision has been \\nwell laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School \\nEducation (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having \\nnurtured the students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five \\nplanes of human existence, the pañchakośhas, in the Foundational \\nand the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression \\nof their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage \\nacts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, \\nspanning three years from Grades 6 to 8.\\nThis framework, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students \\nwith the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their \\nlives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and \\nnarrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and \\nopportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering \\nnine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two \\nlanguages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, \\nArt Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational \\nEducation promotes their holistic development.\\nSuch a transformative learning culture requires certain essential \\nconditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in \\ndifferent curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role \\nin mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike \\na judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities \\nfor exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom \\narrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish \\nconceptual connections both within and across curricular areas.\\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training, on \\nits part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality \\ntextbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been \\nconstituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, \\npedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made \\n0 Prelims.indd   3 23/12/2024   16:06:54\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

Curiosity, Textbook \\nof Science for Grade 6, is one of these. It has been developed in \\nconsonance with the recommendations of NEP 2020 and the \\nNCF-SE 2023 to take students on a journey of experiential learning \\nby citing examples from the world of the learners. The content \\nstimulates curiosity, a sense of exploration, questioning, and critical \\nthinking. The content seamlessly weaves together concepts from \\nphysics, chemistry, biology, and earth science, along with cross-cutting \\nthemes like environmental education, value education, inclusive \\neducation, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). The textbook aims \\nto engage learners through an integrated approach by including \\nmultiple activities and thoughtful use of technology. The textbook \\noffers ample opportunities for reflection and group discussions. \\nTo encourage creativity and innovation, it is feasible to regard \\nstudents as active participants in the learning process, rather than \\nmere recipients of a predetermined set of knowledge. This can \\nonly be achieved if the necessary number of hours are dedicated to \\nscience teaching–learning annually as outlined in NCF-SE 2023. The \\npedagogical approach of the textbook also considers how important \\nit is for students to think critically, reason well and make decisions. \\nIt also provides students with numerous opportunities to learn from \\neach other , making the learning experience more engaging for both \\nteachers and students.\\nHowever , in addition to this textbook, students at this stage \\nshould also be encouraged to explore various other learning \\nresources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such \\nresources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will \\nalso be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so.\\nWith this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been \\ninvolved in the development of this textbook and hope that it \\nwill meet the expectations of all stakeholders.

The policy advocates a radical shift \\nfrom a content-based education to a competency-based education, \\nparticularly in the realm of science. Therefore, the formulation of \\ncurricular goals for Science, subsequent competencies and learning \\noutcomes are tailored towards competency-based learning. These \\ncurricular goals encompass various scientific concepts, including \\nmatter , the physical and living world, health, hygiene, and the \\nexploration of the interface between science, society and technology. \\nAdditionally, the goals focus on the nature of science, its processes, \\nhistorical and contemporary aspects of the development of science \\nand science communication. While these goals are explicitly \\narticulated, they are interdependent and collectively contribute \\nto a better understanding of the world around us. Accordingly, the \\nchapters of this textbook are structured around creative activities, \\nreflective questions, processes and illustrations. The integration of \\nthe concepts from biology, chemistry, physics and earth science, and \\ncross-cutting themes, such as value education, inclusive education, \\nIndian Knowledge Systems (IKS) and environmental education \\nhave been interwoven in the content. Thus, the textbook aims to \\nprovide experience-based learning, rather than simply reading and \\nmemorising the concepts.\\nIn the Middle Stage, science teaching–learning adopts \\nan integrated approach. This integrated approach develops \\nfundamental capacities across biology, chemistry, physics and \\nearth science. The use of an integrated approach helps the learners \\nto appreciate the interrelations between subjects and make sense \\nof their observations and experiences.\\nCuriosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 6, comprises twelve \\nchapters. As the name of the textbook suggests, there are numerous \\nopportunities for the learners to explore the world of science and \\nits nature. Through the chapters, learners will embark on a journey \\nthat will connect them to the world around and spark curiosity for \\nfurther exploration.

These activities are inclusive in nature. Some \\nactivities require both the teacher and learners to prepare in \\nadvance.\\nChapter 1, titled ‘The Wonderful World of Science’, provides a \\nholistic view of the new topic of Science introduced in the Middle \\nStage. It showcases, through examples, the essence of Science—a \\nway of thinking, observing, and finding out by doing, and by asking \\nquestions. This chapter weaves together the concepts covered in \\nthe rest of the book, and aims to excite the readers as they start \\ntheir adventures into the world of science. There are no assessment \\nexercises in this chapter and is designed to be non-evaluative. \\nAlso, every chapter in the book begins with an introduction that \\nmakes the learners curious and tries to show different ways with \\nwhich the goals of the curriculum can be achieved effectively. \\nThe chapters begin with the stories related to real-life situations, \\nthese are meant to capture learners’ interest and connect them \\nwith what is already known. The various activities given are based \\non scientific processes, designed to provide hands and minds-on \\nexperiences. Following each activity, there are questions to help \\nlearners understand and assess how well they have grasped the \\ninformation. Questions are significant in the learning process. They \\nhelp learners to explore and reinforce their understanding. One will \\nalso find many thought-provoking questions designed to encourage \\ndeep thinking, self-awareness and critical analysis. These questions \\nprompt learners to ponder and delve deeper into their thoughts.\\nIn order to sustain the interest of the readers, some of the \\nchallenging ideas, additional information, poems, stories, strange \\nfacts and other interesting materials are also presented as add on \\nnon-evaluative content in the boxes labelled ‘Do you know?’, ‘More \\nto know!’, ‘Think it over!’ and ‘More to do!’. The thrill of scientific \\ninquiry comes from pursuing the unknown, giving learners the \\nopportunity to think and explore beyond the syllabus. Some chapters \\nalso include a section called ‘Know a scientist’, which presents the \\ncontributions of Indian scientists related to that concept. All these box \\nitems, including brief biographies of scientists, are non-evaluative. \\nThe important ideas and steps in understanding a given concept \\nof science are included as ‘Keywords’ at the end of each chapter . \\nThese ‘Keywords’ will help learners to acknowledge various  \\n0 Prelims.indd   6 23/12/2024   16:06:56\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

These words guide \\nlearners on how scientific knowledge is generated, tested and \\napplied. ‘Summary’ offers an overview of the chapter’s main points, \\nreinforcing the key ideas discussed. It serves to outline the content \\npresented in the chapter . A non-evaluative interesting element that \\nhas been incorporated in some of the chapters is the introduction of \\ncertain verses from various Indian texts to promote rootedness in \\nthe learners as envisaged in NEP 2020.\\nThe primary aim of Curiosity is to prepare the children for \\nbecoming the responsible members of the society, and therefore \\nefforts have been made to raise awareness about various issues, such \\nas gender , region, environment, health and hygiene, water scarcity \\nand energy conservation. Activities given in the book endeavour to \\npromote peer-learning and group activities.\\nThe assessment exercises, ‘Let us enhance our learning’, play \\na vital role in the learning process. They help to reinforce the \\nunderstanding and identify areas for improvement, making them \\nessential components of effective teaching and learning. Assessment \\nconsists of various exercises, from pictorial questions to creating \\npuzzles and multiple-choice questions, to create a challenging \\nand interesting experience for the learners. These questions also \\nfacilitate the evaluation of various competencies expected to be \\ndeveloped through a particular chapter . Peer and group activities \\nto explore answers to the questions are also encouraged.\\nA significant feature of the book is what we termed as ‘Learning \\nfurther’. In this section, some projects and activities are designed to \\nincrease learners’ interaction with experts, teachers, parents and \\nthe wider community. Learners are encouraged to gather diverse \\ninformation and draw their own conclusions. \\nThe textbook is just one way to learn. Learners should enhance \\ntheir knowledge by exploring and observing their surroundings. \\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) can also be a \\nvaluable tool for learners’ learning and development, when used \\nappropriately.

Why is it so? Why does the biodiversity of \\na region vary from that of another? Let us find out.\\nThere is very little water available in the deserts. A hot \\ndesert is typically very hot during the day and very cold at \\nnight. Therefore, you will find plants and animals in these \\nareas that can tolerate and survive both the hot conditions \\nduring the day and cold conditions at night. The fleshy stems \\nof plants found in the desert can store water and help them \\ntolerate the hot conditions in these places. \\nThe mountains in extremely cold regions experience \\nfrequent snowfall.

On the other hand, the \\nheight and legs of camels of a cold desert are comparatively \\nshorter than those found in a hot desert. These short legs \\nallow them to walk easily in mountainous regions.\\nFig. 2.11: A camel living in the hot \\ndesert of Rajasthan\\nHooves\\nFig. 2.12: A camel living in the \\ncold desert of Ladakh\\nHooves\\nChapter 2.indd   25 10/21/2024   9:59:45 AM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

Camels store food \\nin their humps. Camels found in the hot desert have one \\nhump each that helps them to survive during the scarcity of \\nfood. Camels found in the cold desert have two humps each. \\nThese two humps shrink in late winters because there is not \\nmuch food available in the cold desert and they have to use \\nfood stored in their humps during that time. Moreover, they \\ngrow long hair from head to neck, which help them survive \\nthe cold winters of Ladakh. \\nWhat other features can help camels to survive in the \\ndesert?\\nOther students also start sharing their observations. \\nKashi from Rajasthan says that camels excrete small \\namounts of urine, their dung is dry, and they do not sweat. \\nAs camels do not lose much water from their bodies, they \\ncan survive for many days without drinking water. \\nMaya talks about seeing plants with beautiful bright \\nflowers, rhododendrons, in the Shola forests of Nilgiris. \\nHere, rhododendrons are of shorter height and have smaller \\nleaves to survive through the heavy winds on mountain \\ntops.

The end of the magnet that points \\ntowards north direction is called the North-seeking pole or \\nthe North pole of the magnet. The other end that points \\ntowards the South direction is called the South-seeking \\npole or the South\\xa0pole of the magnet.

This activity provides us with a way \\nto test whether a piece of metal is a magnet or not. \\nThe property of a freely suspended magnet to always rest \\nalong the north-south direction is used to find directions. \\nBased on this, a small device called a magnetic compass was \\ndeveloped in olden days for finding directions.

The units to \\nmeasure the volume are litre (L) and millilitre (mL).\\nKilogram is the unit of mass in the International System \\nof Units (SI). Kilogram is abbreviated in lower case as kg. \\nThere is no space between ‘k’ and ‘g’ in kg, and no full \\nstop after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. \\nWhile writing the mass, always leave a space between \\nthe number (numerical value) and the unit. For example, \\nif we have mass of 7 kilograms, it would be written as \\n7 kg and not as 7 kgs.\\nSimilarly, litre is abbreviated as capital L and \\nmillilitre as mL. There is no space between ‘m’ and ‘L’ \\nin mL. For example, if you have 500 millilitres of water, \\nit would be written as 500 mL, m will be in lower \\ncase and L will be in upper case. The SI unit for \\nvolume is cubic metre, abbreviated as m\\n3. The \\nabbreviation is written with a superscript 3 to \\ndenote cubic metre. For example, if you have \\nvolume of 2 cubic metres, it would be written \\nas 2 m\\n3.

While going to school, Aavi and \\nThirav observe that there are a lot of water puddles in the \\nplayground. That evening, when they go to play, they are \\nsurprised to observe that some of the water in the puddles \\nhad disappeared. \\nHave you ever noticed water \\nin the puddles disappearing? \\nWhere does it go? Discuss with \\nyour friends. \\nWhere else have you seen \\nwater disappearing? Can you \\nthink of a possible reason why this   \\n          happens? \\nYou migh\\nt have observed that after washing the \\nutensils, water left on the surface of the utensils, dries \\nup after some time. Does the reason you thought earlier \\nto explain water disappearance apply in this case also? \\nAavi wonders if water has seeped through the surface of \\nthe utensils.\\nThirav thinks that water does not seep through the \\nsurface of the utensils. Design an activity to investigate \\nwhose idea is correct. \\nActivity 8.2: Let us investigate \\n \\x8b Take a tablespoon of water on a steel plate as shown in \\nFig. 8.1.\\n \\x8b Observe whether water seeps through to \\nthe other side of the plate or not.\\n \\x8b Keep observing this at regular intervals \\nuntil the water completely disappears.\\nWhat do you infer? Is this activity enough \\nto come to the conclusion that water does \\nnot seep through a steel plate? \\nIf water does not seep through the steel \\nplate. Then, where has the water gone? \\nThis water gets converted into gaseous \\nstate called water vapour. The water vapour is \\nanother state of water. Let us think of another \\nobservation where you notice the water \\ndisappearing.\\nWhile making dosa, we sprinkle some water \\non the hot pan and it disappears. Where does \\nit go?  \\nFig. 8.1: Steel plate with  \\na tablespoon of water\\nThe water which is sprinkled on the hot \\npan gets converted into steam. Steam is \\nactually water vapour, some part of which \\nconverts into water droplets. \\nThe process of conversion of water into \\nits vapour state is called evaporation. \\nThe process of evaporation takes place continuously, \\neven at room temperature. Can you think of other examples \\nof evaporation? \\nDrying of wet clothes, mopped floor, and sweat on our \\nbody are some examples of it.\\nNow what do you think is the reason for the disappearance \\nof water from the puddles? Is it due to: (i) seeping of water \\ninto the ground or (ii) evaporation of water or (iii) both of \\nthese?\\nHand sanitiser disappears as you rub it on your hands. \\nWhat happens to it? \\nWater vapour is \\nactually invisible \\nbut the \\npresence of \\ntiny droplets \\nof water in the \\nsteam makes it \\nvisible.\\nDo you \\nknow?\\nLet us draw\\nDraw a detailed sketch (with labels and \\ncaption) about what happens to the water.\\nChapter 8.indd   145 10/4/2024   3:11:29 PM\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

Gases do not \\npossess a fixed shape. Water vapour exists even at room \\ntemperature; though it is invisible to us. It is present in the \\nair around us.

Notice the movement of their abdomen \\nwhile they are taking rest. \\nIn the process of breathing, when we inhale, the air \\nmoves from outside to inside our body. When we breathe \\nout, the air moves from inside our body to outside. \\nBreathing is part of a process called respiration. Do \\nplants also respire?

The effects of the following \\nconditions have been seen in Activity 10.2.\\nWater: Seeds require water for germination. \\nWater enables the seeds to carry out the \\nprocesses necessary for their growth. The outer \\ncovering of the seed is called seed coat. Water \\nsoftens the seed coat and helps the tiny embryo \\ninside it to develop into a plant.\\nAir and Soil: Seeds need air for germination. They use the \\nair available in the spaces between soil particles. Moreover, \\nspaces between the soil particles allow roots to grow easily.\\nLight and/or dark conditions: We have learnt that for \\nthe bean seeds, presence of light is not essential for their \\ngermination.

Also, \\nyour house may be surrounded by tall buildings and trees, \\nwhich may block your view. The night sky is best viewed \\nfrom open dark areas. \\nLight pollution is growing sharply globally. This is reducing our \\nability to enjoy and study objects in the night sky. Some \\ndark sky reserves and parks have been established \\naround the world. Light pollution in the reserves is \\ncontrolled to preserve dark skies for research. There \\nare a few organisations which are working to educate \\npeople about reducing light pollution.\\nDo you \\nknow?\\nNot all stars and constellations are visible from \\nall places on Earth and on all nights in a year. \\nFor example, the Pole Star is not visible from \\nthe southern hemisphere of Earth.
